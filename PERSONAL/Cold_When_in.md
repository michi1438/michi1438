Cold as a placement for not being able to express your actual feelings
-	13.09.25	-  
I just read this passage in Demon Copperhead (a book my mother offered me, as I'm going through an ''emotional wakeup call'' of the sad and 'heavy on my soul' type..), and that passage talked about this young son of a, junkie getting back on the wagon, her being very high spirited trying to see all the beauty of their future life. The whole thing is hard for him of course, but the interesting aspect is, he really wants to be nice with her, to not overwhelm her as he can tell she is in a fragile state, obviously, but his situation is extreme, he doesn't feel like or simply can't allow himself to be tender, to care about her, mainly because it might involve him getting hurt now (giving her one less reason to fix herself, because his love for her is unconditional) or later when she eventually breaks, he will have been giving to a useless cause. And therefore his reaction is to be uncontrollably cold, to give the strict opposite impression than the one he really feels and deeply wants to transmit, and now you are scared of what you might accidentally say in that reactionary state, it can only express more of what you don't want to express.
My point being more generally that it is a frightening thing to give, if the other is not able or doesn't want to receive and you end up giving the strict opposite feeling as a sort of defense mechanism, what would be the right attitude, what should you do ?
Why is it frightening, because you might be wasting, she might really not want you or want you to, you might be wrong, humiliated, to be scared of what the other expects, you try to be respectful of their choices but end up giving them illusions of what their choices are (a horribly cold uninterested person, in the book's case that means ''she has no reason making the effort for your son because he doesn't care for you..'') and they are again completely opposite to what you actually want to convey...  
I should say I have a very specific/personal situation in mind that I assimilate to this, as I try to step through this idea...
What comprises ''doesn't want or isn't able to receive'' ?

So it's been 2 days and I had my ups and downs, mostly downs, I kept on reading a bit of Demon Copperhead, but found less of those moral/spiritual intricacies/question in the type of the one above, more of the general sadness and hardship, which has its value, but less so if I expect myself to write about anything... I've started another book, Ted Chiang - Stories of Your Life and Others, the second short story "Understand" is about a man going through the phases of some drug trial that lead him to ''super intelligence" and somehow written as a biographie/journal with that sort of fast pace thinking, shooting ideas, having parallel thoughts and conversation with a doctor and transmitting his ideas flawlessly and convincingly, truly impressive.  
These themes of people going very intelligent, seeing patterns and the feeling of rigorous fast pace that usually comes with it, has always fascinated and especially captivated me (kyle XY, limitless, lucy and now this story). Anyway being absorbed by this book and thinking of problems and schemes that are so far ahead, does make me relativize my ''minor'' emotional crisis, I say minor now, because of the step back, it really feels like the end all be all of emotional bubble bursts when it's there...  
And now the other day kinda feels senseless, I realise I'm lying to myself and I already knew but not to that extent... Trying to step through it, is just a way for me to justify what I want to do anyway, that is, act as thought I was emotionally benevolent trying to say I don't mean to act the way I do (the whole ''cold instead of tender'' mentioned the other day) when the actual reason is I want to open other doors give it more chances. All this would not be morally incriminating (it might even be seen as a pretty clever seduction move) if it is done under the ''banner of love''.
But that means jackshit, is it love/passion or is it just a bunch of emotion led by pure narcissism/selfishness; a bit of desire, attachment, more desire, then fueled by the glimpse I got of the other's desire, and the gasoline to this bonfire would be rejection and jealousy, could that be love ?
Rather this self pity is valid or not no one cares fundamentally, what counts is the greater good.. And what counts to me is, what I want, understanding it, understanding myself, how to get it and get it, keeping in mind that if I hurt, I burn myself in the process...
One part of the story ''Understand'' really got me thinking, the ''Zero Experience'', the merging of subject and object, a way to say ''non-duality'', dissolution of self and of the frontier between you and the object, or just see life as a whole and you are not one in it you are one with it... ^^  
Part of me sees it as the ultimate cop out, the communism of moral dilemma, nothing is your fault, nothing is good or bad, it's all just part of the system, but damn it is beautiful and appealing.
One last point and I'm done, I want to know more about myself. I want better and sober, clear and sincere introspection, I think I can do that.  
One big issue I have right now is, I'm lost, I don't know where I'm going and that was alright most of my life but if you are sad/depressed, well now, how do you ''stay the course''... I'm thinking of setting some higher/abstract objectives, understanding myself, while I find a more surface/traditional ''course to set''. I should seek a professional's help, not with specifics but general ideas.  
done.

This is to be added after my last entry yesterday, 02.11. We may have found balance...  
There  are many things about any type of romantic relationship and especially one with me that scares her. We have known each other for 6 years now. It is a lot of different aspects of it that stopped her until now, I won't pretend I get most of it, I don't, but I understand a bit more every time we have one of those conversations, the un-tiing of the knot happened with what I perceive to be largely a pretext, I only said what I fought that she was not responsible for it, reassuring her that her role was not an evil one in our relationship, that I knew at least a little what I was doing and I am still running willingly towards it. This and jealousy brought us to explore the idea of an open relationship, where you have ways to avoid letting jealousy get the best of you (honnesty, openness and confidence), and making it less of a commitment, a lighter approach to relationships, this almost seems like a healthier way to start building.  
Once things were set and we knew it was alright there was no awkwardness. Things went fluid and natural, very trusting of one another, I enjoyed it at least as much as I thought I would...

About 2 months after, up until christmas vacation we had spent 2 weeks at least laying together almost every evening... It was nice, I saw the face that says more than she would want to admit, not that it overruled what she said when her brain caught up, I would just like her to not think of them as mutually exclusive. Then during her vacation, of about a week and a half, she probably skipped only 1 or 2 days of messaging me as she went to bed late, sometimes saying things that she would later ''regret'' and expressing things she wouldn't admit to in the daytime ^^... (I said in the middle of the night everybody loves everybody else these days - Ezra Furman & The Harpoons).  
After all that, she came home. Me. expecting us to jump into each other's arms. Her, trying to, if I had to guess, invalidate what was said and what was felt by ignoring the whole thing and not addressing it... I've been trying to give her space, leave her room, respect what was understood implicitly, now I want her to be explicit, so I will be explicit in actions !  
I've by the way started reading master and margarita nicolaievna, a bit more than half way, there is finally one or two ideas that I like, the sort of ''thought experiment'' that seem to me as gestalts, a very aesthetic logical idea that says so much more than what it appears to be saying, like gateways to understanding fundamentals of humans or nature.
