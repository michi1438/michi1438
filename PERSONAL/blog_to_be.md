Actual AI and programing inteligence, I dont beleive that the "singularity" 
or anything close to inteligence from a computer is close to happening. 
But for the sake of argument, and completely ignoring the ethics os the subject...

How do we define inteligence, processing power might be a part of it but, 
I believe that we expect a bit more from a human...Maybe adaptability, now there are computer
or at least programs that have a bit of flexibility, at the most simplictic level it's
conditional programs, but there are extremes that in a sense mimic human better. 
I'm thinking of "machine learning" behaviors are at first output semi-randomly and then through
generation those behaviors are either rewarded if they help get closer
to the objective or dicarded if useless. The idea being that the program used in a different 
scenario yet similar context will have good chances of making the objective.
Go watch "Deep Learning Cars" on youtube to get a feel for what I just explained or massacred...

So what is different between that and us besides complexity, well to reward the machine
we need to have a set of values in the program as we do in our brain right...
In the case of a program we hard set those values once, 
for us humans (hopefuly) they evolve over time, scenarios, and context we encounter.
That might be something we can implement in a program... 
Alright but this is called learning or evolution, and we humans cultivated that over 2 million years,
now the cool thing about video games, as my mother use to worry would desensitize 
me to danger, is that you never realy die, 
we can simulate the process of evolution ad infinitum but then it becomes a 
computational power probleme. 

To try to wrap it up, I would say there are three main subject for a real Artificial Inteligence
in my mind at least, a set of values and the capacity to create new ones or modify them, 
a full range of random actions to try to give as many options to what a good behavior could be,
and finally some way to judge for all domains or values if it got closer to what it meant to do,
all this is whith out mentioning the amount of data to store in that robot, and the simulation
that would basically need to be 2 Milion year of earth. 

We are truly amazing creatures...

Moravec's paradox is the idea that a computer is able to do certain tasks way faster than a
human could dream of doing, and all the will that some things that a human does (in particular 
sensorimotor and perception oriented actions) are hard to mimic with a computer...

To put an image to this, try to imagine both parties with some random big number multiplication 
it is relatively easy to program a computer to do this by adding this that many times,
I say relatively because starting from scratch is still a huge amount of knowledg and work,
now for humans, although they are able to do the multiplication it is going to take 
a long time and we are prone to errors.
Comparing this to an action that is in a sens more basic, like moving an arm through space,
remembering or feeling where it lies, is a pretty inate and unthought action, as it turns out
these are the hardest problemes in computer science. As Hans Moravec wrote in 1988 
"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence test
or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when
it comes to perception and mobility".

There are, to me, two sides to an explication to that "problem", as we've previously brushed on,
anything that relates to subconscience is a product of evolution and therefore 2 million years 
of the homo genus gets us a pretty flawless and well optimized sensorimotor use, comparatively 
the abstract thought process (as number manipulation) is a pretty recent process 
in the human brain. 
The second angle, is in a sens linked, computers are based on numbers and our recently acquiered
abstract appreciation, so are optimized to solve problems that are derived from mathematics, 
else require from us reverse engineering on processes seamingly easy, but ununderstood for the 
most part, like facial recognition as an example.

This also ties to the fact that we tend towards good result from emulating wild life (wich is 
the result of a long evolution), in the appropriate technology. 


Hans Moravec, has also written/researched "skyhooks", a sort of theorised "space tether".

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) talks both of DNA fragements 
and the subsequent tool discovered to isolate snippets of DNA through the defence mechanisme of
very simple organisms called Prokaryotes, single-celled nucleus-less, Bacteria and Archaea,
differentiated from their nucleied cousin Eukaryota (who dont have the same defence mechanisim).

Around 2012 biologist found inside those Prokaryotes broken pieces of DNA left behind from 
various bacteriophages (viruses) those DNA sequences are then used by their host to recognise 
and later with the use of Cas9 an enzyme cuts them as they try to breach.

What now is known as CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique, is a realitively simple and cheap tool
used both by labs and biohackers around the world, this brought up a number of questions and 
potential applications (de-extinction, medecin, genetic self improvement and the ethical 
questions that come with).
De-extinction is just what it sounds like, basically Jurassique Park, although DNA degrades 
over time, but a step towards that idea anyway.
This plus the prospect of super-strenght/intelligence leaves for a great science-fiction idea...

So we just ascended the Mont Blanc :), ~4810m, there are a few things that I think are worth 
stating.
The size is approximative since it is a perennial ice/snow dome and it's thickness varies it is 
hard to give it a precise height, it fluctuates by 1 or 3 meters over the 20 last years. There 
is one fact to keep in mind when up there, the summit is a layer of 28 meters of ice and as it 
turns out is different from the rock summit that is 40 meters to the west and lies below 
14 meters of ice. Not specificaly relevant to the Mont Blanc, but in general for the 
thought experiment how would you mesure mount everest in the 1950's, 
it was a very thought problem...

Another intresting idea was that of the tri-fecta that comes up as you go up, the cold, 
the lack of energie and the lack of oxygene. The ascend is not an easy thing at all, it's hard
but in an other sens it is very accessible because the challenge is not one of either, 
raw strengh, endurence or mental thoughtness. It is a mix of all three, the person that brought
me to the mont blanc kept saying how the acsend put us all in the same boat... I didn't beleive
him untill we got up there and we saw a group of 60 year old belgian, well fed and who cleary 
enjoyed there local trapist culture. It turns out it's hard for everyone, and I think it is 
well resumed by that trifecta, when one hits the 2 follow fast and the link is close,
therefore seeing it from a different point of vue, a well balanced person might be able compensate 
one with the other... That leaves a place for everyone, but keeps it a challenge for all...

Fusion is always 30 years away, and other cognitive biases on scientifique accomplishment
expectations.
It is both a recuring joke amongst physicist and an actual belief among them, for the last 100 
years most expert on the subject believe fusion is to be achieved in the next 20 to 30 years, 
what does this say about the science, us and our beliefs. 
Allied to this idea, we (Humans) have a tendencies to expect with no basis that, life changing 
or extanding technology is to come before our death. For a physicist that have a few years 
experience around 30 to 35 year old estimating it to 30 years in the future lets them see this 
technology before the "death" of their career, it might partially be because we can hardly 
fathom a longer period for research than a lifetime or because we can't accept that our work
will not reward us in our life (understandable)...
At a public level we mostly expect for life extanding tech to come up before our time for the 
same reason the physicist imagines his work giving back.  

That might also both say how much we actually don't know about that specific subject, fusion, 
and be a very useful bias for humans to have as a species to progress, our will to progress on 
such a precise subject might be diminished by knowing we will not benifit in our life time of 
those 30 years of really really hard math. And with all that you can't be nominated for a 
nobel prize post-hume...

Nuclear fusion might really be 30 years away this time.

How to write to be intresting and understood ? Should you "improv your writing" or be
careful and organise into drafts your work ?

There probably isn't a clear cut answer to how to make a write intresting, else we would
all read the same books and everybody would be a great writer, life would be incredibly dull.
The things we find intresting seem to differ from medium to medium and style to style, 
but in general I would say we are intrested in ideas we haven't come accross yet or that are 
not fully understood by our brain. Scratching that curiosity of humans. These ideas can come 
in the form of facts, fictions and sometimes as purely the idea, as we migth encounter in 
philosophy. The rate at which those ideas that you are intrested in appear in the medium
is also important, and this relates to the level you have on the subject that you are reading 
compared to the level of the book you chose. If you choose a book about additions for 5 
years old, chances are you won't be enthused by it, although you could argue that if it was 
your book when you were 5, you could find great intressed in this book, though this might be 
a different subject or you could be scratching that curiosity.
The question, "are we looking for exact answers ?" is a hard one, if you are already intressted 
in the subject if the right ideas have been presented you could start looking for facts, 
this to me is a different work, although you may find a bit of both in some books,
academic books are not intresting, per say, they build on a pre-existing interest.

And about being understood, this might still be subjective therefore depend on the subject and 
the approach to the idea. 
This is what I'm going to use as a segway to talk about "improv writing", the general idea is 
to make a distinction between, the traditional approach of drafts and then rearranging your 
thougths to publish a understandable and ordered train of thought, and the freestyle, 
improvised, sometimes slopy, and "cross your fingers" for what you wrote to make sens, style.

My guess is that both style have their place in different context, although the second might
be harder to defend to a general public... And in that sens the most intresting "for argument 
sake" to try and defend.
Here is a list of facts(that are really just my opinion), the rate of ideas output in a 
freestyle text is necessarily higher, the ideas are presented as in a conversation and keeps
you in the conversation, it is a lot easier to write wich means it outputs a lot more and may 
remain free, you can make mistakes (if your objective is to introduce ideas) there are no false
ideas... There are probably a lot more arguments, more or less valid, but that's an other 
advantage, the subject being infinite, I can stop whene...

My rules for a good life, this is a new set of rules that follow one I had put in action 
and on paper "Rebirth of old comitments, a new entry" on the 25/08/2022.
The idea was then to act on ideas I had for a while, but unless extreme change in your mind,
it is hard to uphold and usually short lived. So those ideas postpone till then,
althought they are pretty basic I realise that changing one little aspect of a pretty cyclic 
life is harder as the rest of your routine pushes you back to that habit you were trying 
to kick.
Last time I was aiming for a simple and higher pleasures but all the while rich experience, 
work towards being a likable, welcoming and easy person to approach, intresting and intrested.
Two other ideas which I haven't paid much attention to applying because they are less directly
applied are also relatively important in a general aim toward futur me; don't live for others 
help only if help is wanted or at least not refused, and have regrets and not remorse,
where regrets entones recognising "mistakes" and a will to move foward, while remorse conveys 
the asking for forgiveness that looks a lot like auto-flagellation.
Those were followed by the usual, stop smoking, stop biting your finger nails, get things done,
get to work(unrelated to employment), only "higher pleasures" (no movies, no series, no video 
games, no drugs, little alcohol (to not look insane)), read more, read smarter...

Now to add to these rules and to underline the ones that were underminded last time, 
stop biting your nails, be scared and do anyways (rationalise your fears, hanggliding,
climbing, money...), move foward, read more in the evening before you sleep and not in bed, 
don't cheat to fall asleep, more math, clean your room, and your surroundings, workout, 
don't make everything easier with music...

More to come, hopefully, it's called progess...

Paleontology, paleoclimatology and how it helps understand climate change.
The difference between weather and climate, was not so obvious to me, weather is based on 
a short time prediction, it already is hard to be accurate about weather, climate on the other
hand is the study of weather tendencies over a longer period arround a decade as a minimum. 
So when we talk about climate change we are talking about a change in the average weather over 
a certain period.
Paleontology is the study of what came before the holocene (~12000 years before present),
it mainly includes the study of fossiles and their classification, but also their interaction,
(paleoecology). Paleoclimatology is the study of past climates, it is done through geological
and biological evidences called "climate proxies" preserved in sediments, rocks, tree rings, 
coral, ice sheets... Basicaly the study of climate before we have any records of it, 
through detective work mainly.
This is one aspect to understanding the effects of greenhouse gases and general cycles 
or feedback loops the earth puts itself on... ice ages and greenhouse periods are
at least for a time positive feedback examples, at least for a time because there always was 
a negative feedback that kicks the earth out of that cycle. 
Examples of positive feedback in glacial periods would be the albedo (reflection of light)
increase as more of the earth is covered in ice or snow earth absorbing therfore less of the 
solar radiation. For the greenhouse period it would be the higher concentration of water vapour 
in the atmosphere due to heat, and in turn increasing the greenhouse effect by traping and 
absorbing more radiation from the sun. The carbon dioxide is less important here, where it is 
potentialy important is as the starter to this feedback loop...

The one idea that stuck relating to how we should act about climate change is;
When driving down a road that fast, not knowing what lies beyond a corner doesn't mean 
you don't want to slow down...

about albedo, cool stuff...

"Finnegan's Wake" is a James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (1882-1941) a very weird, 
almost unreadable, yet considered a masterpiece...
The title itself comes from a somber reference to  the name of a mock-irish stage song of the
same title from the 1850's and making a few intertwining reference with the words "whiskey",
being "water of life" in Gaelic, "wake", the fact that it is a lively danse,
and that we all rise as a Finnegan does in the song.

Wikipedia describes the book as being written in James joyce's idiosyncratic language, 
blending standard English words with "neologistic portmanteau" words, Irish mannerisms
and puns in multiple languages. To that you can add a huge vocabulary and you get a near 
unreadable book. This being said there seems to be a huge community of people on forums 
and wiki pages helping to "decypher" the book. 

A lot of very smart people have referenced the book in all sorts of way, one such man is 
Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel Prize winning American Physicist, that gave the name of "quarks" to
the fundemental partical, the name comes from the phrase "Three quarks for Muster Mark! Sure 
he hasn't got much of a bark And sure any he has it's all beside the mark."
The word meaning croak in old english but it is disputed that Joyce took it from a trip to 
Freiburg, "quark" is in this sens a German word of Slavic origin, which has as first meaning 
"a curd of cheese", (a fraction of a whole) but also in a colloquial manner holds the maybe more 
appropriate sens "trivial nonsens"...

The "All powerful, all Evil god" is an idea, a thought experiment proposed as a challenge by 
philosopher Stephen Law, wich I heard on that podcast "philosophy bites.
Most monotheistique religion that have seen light, were discovered/created with an
all benevolent god, the atheist counter argument to a all good god is usually in the likes of 
"why then is there suffering in the world" the answer to that is yet again pretty straight
foward "how could you enjoy a rainbow if you always had rainbows and never a cloudy/sad day?".
That does make a point, or at least does not disprove the existance of a fullon good god.

What is more troubling in this view of the world is, why would it not be an all evil, 
all powerful god, "well how could it be we see so much good in the world then" you can see 
where this is taking us, "the only reason there is good things in this world is so that when 
you get hit by the bus you realize how much you are actualy loosing". It turns out the same 
argument is applicable in both situation, you could try to argue that the proportions are 
in favor of a benevolent god, truth being it is very hard to quantify good or evil, and it 
might be very unfair to 3/4 of the world to think that they are all having a 
jolly good time.

So why is the god we chose a good one, well to me at least it looks like a typical human bias
we want a happy life therefore we condition our self to see it as good, therefore the power 
that controles it is good...
In a sens this links back to the anthropic principle, since we are part of the universe we
are made to fit in it, rather you see it as a sign of inteligent design or an explanation to 
our biase (it is normal for us to enjoy in the most part the hand that we are dealt)...

All in all I think it is a hard question, with probably no answer.

David Hume said "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence"...

Mycology is changing and so are muchrooms. We went out for bolete, a few sweet tooth (hydnum),
saffron milk caps and other agaric, and laccaria with a mycologist yesteday so we could get the 
scientifique point of view on mushrooms and a few tips and trics.
Mushroom that were considered "good edibles" 5 or 10 years ago are now considered deadly, 
"Gyromitra esculenta" is a good example of such a mushroom, whose name in latin literaly means 
delicious is now considered toxic, while some people have eaten it and been fine, others have 
died, the toxicity comes from gyromitrin, when hydrolyzed (either while cooking or ingesting)
gyromitrin becomes monomethylhydrazine (that is used as rocket propellant, as Orbital 
maneuvering system (OMS) and reaction control system (RCS), so not "escaping earth" propellant)
a very toxic compound that act on the central nerveous system, one other question is "could that
be a sign of mutation, maybe not in the case of Gyromitra esculenta, but more generaly, 
could fungy mutate with our presence to produce more of certain compounds... Could they become 
deadly...

Relating to that subject it turns out mushrooms from different areas have different 
concentrations of active substance, "Amanita Muscaria" is our example this time it is known as 
the fly agaric to most and is also used as a recreational drug mostly shamanic, but in norden
Italy (but also else were...), it is traditionaly consumed (when well prepared and in small 
quantities), when a group of italian woodcutters came to the other side of the Mont-Blanc in
Haute-Savoie for a job, they ate the same mushroom they ate at home except the fly agarics in 
france are different so they got high, I don't think it whent much further in that story...
But it goes to show a point, that mushroom evolved a bit different from one place to the next 
and you should beware of other countries mushroom even if they look like yours...

Dyson sphere and dyson swarm, a relatively far futur.
In Sci-fi we've seen ideas of a dyson sphere or swarm, to be explicit, the concept revolves 
around a civilisation, probably more tecnologicaly advanced than ours presently, in dire need 
of energy. They would produce self replicating robots that over some time would start building 
"solar panels" around the sun, that is the dyson sphere, or around different asteroids near the
sun, and that would be the dyson swarm.
Although this seems like a laughable subject, even to me, there are multiple things to talk 
about. This concept was postulated by a British-American theorecical physicist called 
Freeman Dyson in the 1960's, not only as a potential human futur, but also implicitly as a 
means to search for potential advanced civilisation, that would be using something similar, 
the reason being, anything absorbing that much energy from a star would output some form of 
infrared signature visible through the universe, so looking for those stars with an exces in 
infrared light could be a way to find other supra inteligent life forms... 

Beyond the fact that it is for now unreachable, all the technology involved in this endeavour 
are mostly there automation, programation, space minning, solar panels, wireless transfert of 
energy, at least none of them break physics. Admitting large amounts of time the fleet could 
be huge and have huge tasks to accomplish. 
Does it make sens, or is it useful to imagine this futur ? Hard to say, but it can't be bad 
for us to adapte our ideas to fit futur big changes and an aim for science in general maybe 
what helps young people into science with the idea to change science fiction into science fact.
I believe that is what Star Trek did for a lot of people...

Reclling your dreams is hard but may be rewarding.
The idea is simple as you go to sleep take a piece of paper by your side an fall asleep 
with the thought of when you wake up, writing and remembering your dream in a foggy but 
detailed way, you want to do it fast dream seem to have a very small memory space and it seems 
to be wiped out fast (up to the point were you are convinced if you don't do that exercise, 
that you haven't dreamt).
Why could it be intresting to write your dreams, it is an occasion to make your creativity work
for you in moments where it is totaly unhinged and uninhibited, it is your connection to your
subconcsience it is one way you treat past information of the day, and finally there's the holy 
grail of "lucid dreaming" it is not entirely far fetch to say you could realize and take 
controle of your dream. Maybe not in the same exagerated state as "inception", but at worst to
challenge a time of your day where you are not doing much...
Because of a recent encounter, all in all laughable because of its exageration, a person that
in most time seams reasonable and almost normal, litteraly believes in ghosts, talking to them, 
and seeing them. This shouldn't affect me that much, but he called me out for acknoledging a
spiritual belief and linking that to the "obvious" fact that I believed in the same stuff,
I really just knew the term used "purification" (with white sage), basically he said, 
"you must believe in it since you knew of it".
I am since very scared of associating my self to pseudo-science and pushing foward ideas that
are not hard science, like "lucid dreaming" that is at worst theoritical, but the wall is then
thin enough to break into unfounded beliefs.

Anyways I'll remember that to try to associate someone in your beliefs in general is not a very 
likeable thing, and is almost hurtful, that was a bit of a tangeant...

Again proportion your beliefs to the evidence... David Hume

About beliefs, wisen people and an other log to further establish my personal beliefs.
I'm assuming a lot to write this and my point is to clear my thoughts about the subject, so 
this is to be taken lightly (altough I am writing assertivaly).
Beliefs are a concept on wich we have smaller control than we believe, we often hear phrases of
the sort, "I choose to believe that..." sometimes not as ironicaly as you might think, try it 
with a friend, "do you believe you have controle on your beliefs ?", if the answer is "yes", 
rather you agree or not the follow up thought experiment is " I'll give you a hundred bucks if
you can believe in the flying pink elephant out there ", it will at least last you an hour...
So you at least can't control the full depth of your belief, on the other hand one way you can 
indirectly affect your beliefs is through experience, the more you confront other ideas the
larger your pool of "things that happen" the more you can sort (consiously or unconsiously)
the next experience either as "a statistical annomaly" or as "a common happening", if something 
falls in the "statistical annomaly" section you are likaly (if you proportion your beliefs to 
the evidence or are even a somewhat rational being) not to believe it. 

This bases itself on a purely rational person, those dont exist, the experience could be a good 
illusion, when you have a lot of surrounding affirmation it can drown other experiences that is
concensus (and this explains how smart and rational people are lead to believe what their 
communities have led them to believe, texans that believe all blacks are evil, young people 
growing up in religious communities, frenchies believing all texans are racists, that is a 
joke), or finnally you could fit outside of a consensus in general, because you like to think 
unconventional thoughts, because you are a rational being in an unrational consensus, or an 
other person is very dumb in a very smart world.

Wisen you are with time if the experiences you live are varied enough and you are a rational 
man, but in the end you are not in direct control...

Conscious choice, unconscious choice is there such a thing as a unconscious choice?
By the main definition a choice is conscious, someone around me has recently emited the counter
to my previous argument, "You cannot choose to believe", and with quite a lot of strengh but 
absolutely no argument except "I choose to believe, in this or that", I don't believe her, and 
I don't think it is a matter of opinion. One reason for her position is defensive since I sort 
of put her on the spot the first time we talked about that idea, anyways this entry is in case 
I'm wrong.
It to me makes sens that a choice is conscious, an unconscious choice would to me determinisme,
or an automatic response to a situation, so a reflex based on past experience, non the less if 
we admit there is such a thing as an unconscious choice then our dispute was on definitions.
If we exclude the idea of unconscious choice it means we must be in controle of our choices and 
"choice" becomes "decision", so "to decide to believe" (I'll try it next time).

What about "believe" what can you make of that word, in it's raw form it is "if I take a sharp
knife and slide it on my finger I believe I'll bleed", how could you have control on that, 
and choose to believe other wise, you could fake it a lot easier, say to others that you don't
believe you will bleed. An exterior variable might be able to brainwash you into believing that 
you don't bleed even that takes tremendous amounts of work, my example might be extreme...
What about something less tangible aliens, "do you believe alien exist?", the good thing about 
extremes is they help you extrapolate, if you spend every night thinking about that question, 
then you are going to change your mind probably a few times and your answer to the general 
subject is going to become more precise, yet your belief is not under your control. 
If you force an idea in your brain, repeat every night that they do exist or not (basically 
brainwashing your self, I would not recomend that...), this will not convince you, or you are
dishonest with yourself. 

There is a nuance, you can choose to educate yourself on the subject and believe in what 
seems, to the extent of your reasearch, as the more rational belief. And in that case you are 
still not choosing your belief, your choosing an educated belief...

That being said it is hard to see the other point of view, and try to defend it...

He doesn't get stuck on my subject, probably makes it more intresting,

Derivatives what I understood about them, and what they are useful for...
The definition of derivative is based on the limits (its hard to expres math without LaTex, and 
this is a skill I'll acquiere later, so just text for now), an other important subject of
Calculus, it could be said that the whole of Calculus is built on limits and derivatives are 
one set of tools to answer specifique questions about a graph or a function (it can be used 
visualy and algerbraicly. In the very general way taking the derivative of a function outputs
a new function, usualy called f', and it represents y="rate of change" as a function to "x". 
This is key to further tools like integrals, but also directly useful as direct substitute for 
the intant slope of a function and therefore is part of the tangeant or local linerazation.
There is such a thing as the derivative of a derivative, otherwise called the second degree 
derivative of f, and represents the rate of change of the rate of change, to put this in 
perspective if we consider f a function that shows y=position as a function of x=time if we 
differentiate f, we get f', it represents the rate of change of that function in other words 
it instantaneous speed and taking the second derivative of f ==> f" gives us the rate of change 
in speed, in other words the acceleration distance over time squared.

There are multiple rules that simplify the work to differentiate complex equation because the
limit based definition ask for a lot of algebra and is very error prone, one of the last part I 
studied is about differentiating implicit function (those are not definable stricly in terms of 
the other variable and is the counterpart to the traditional explicit function) a subject for 
now relatively straight foward but I suspect is a huge source of insight into multivariable...

Having an orginal thought is not as easy of an idea as it might seem, when to start trying to 
find original answers and how.
It may seem like an obvious question, but it is not with no reason that Ralph Emerson wrote his 
most read essaye on that subject 'self reliance'. His position is that we should always strive 
to formulate personal view points and paye special attention to not fall into repeating what 
other people have written because it seems like what you should bring up in society when you 
are a 'well educated' person. Now how could you disagree with that, every one wants to be an 
individual (everybody is both an individual and a part of concensus this is what being a part
of a society is by definition), it is in one sens a pertty unfair challenge, because agreeing 
is conforming, this is a little paradoxical, and disagreeing is both a logical contradiction 
and a bit of a easy cope out. 
This was mainly considering soft science and matters that generaly leave a place to opinion, 
if we think of a subject such as math, I believe the consideration become at least a little 
different. At what point do you start being creative in math, if you start to early you run the 
risk of reinventing the same stuff that already are with a lot of work and little reward, but 
on the other hand you could spend your whole life learning and not consider you know enough to 
allow yourself a little creativaty. Math is cumulative knowledge, you depend on previously 
acquiered tools and knowledge to build or learn the next one. Although there is no cut clear 
answer to that question and it is open for discussion, you could imagine a good balance to be 
something like, give a problem a try at least abstractly anytime you don't know the answer, 
learn the proposed method and see where you stand, the plus side is if your research leads 
nowhere, you at least have a better understanding of the probleme and how the method works...

This applies to all subject if it applies to math, I'll try to apply it... Get back a bit of 
your creativity...

What would be cheating in creativity, drugs. What would be cheating in running, listening 
to music. If you cheat in that sens are you supposed to be less proud of it, is it less of 
an achievement, do we want to reward this kind of achievement in life. 
On an absolute point what is great but produced under influence is still to whom it may 
concern, a "great thing", to mention that this 'thing' was made under the influence, you
add an element to the thing, for people to judge (when judgement is applicable, not for science).
I was about to write, that I didn't know of much scientist that had taken drugs, turns out a quick 
internet search was necessary, Richard Feynnman, Paul Erdos and Ralph Abrahams and supprisingly
they mostly took lsd (creative drugs). But it might of been a passage for most and for the sake 
of experimentation. Nonetheless their achievement are not judged differently by their use of 
drugs. 
Trying it, makes it experimentation, repeating it may make it another experimentation, but making
it a habit is where it looses its use...
One objectif in life and that also applies to high achieving scientist, is to experiment, see
the different points of view to have a global understanding of the probleme, and maybe open 
different solution. This is, admiting you know your subject and have a problem...

The question therefore remains, is there such a thing as cheating your work into a better version,
is it less honorable, or is "cheating"(drugs or music while running) knowing the game and playing
it to the fullest ?

I'm thinking somewhat of my childhood, I was probably about 15 years old, we lived near Bandol, 
close to the beach in provence. Those years I should of lived, as the start of a young man's life 
all seem to me as the youngest, most innocent, barely conscious times of my life!
I remember specificaly the surroundings of Saint Cyr les Lecques, it had a walk-way to it's side 
that I idolise today, it went, (what I believed back then to be steep terrain), a cliff ending on
the water front, whith big and sharp rocks to form a beach, this with a few steps back may mean 
that they fell often and that this beach was probably a dangerous place to go. It was also one 
of the pretiest sight of my teens. I remember going on my bicycle early in the morning to this 
heavenly place with a throwable kodak camera, that ride probably took me around 2h and was of 
~20km (that might be wrong) from that day I don't have many images stored in my head, I knew 
it was one of the truly georgeous sight of my young age, you could imagine the sunrise on the sea being 
sifted by the Pinus pinea needles, a sharp cliffy scenary and the sens of adventure of a young teen. 
I think this is what acted the most on what I remember of those days...
I also believe this is what I see as a grown up in the stories of Sylvain Tesson, Robert Macfarlane, 
and Nicolas Bouvier, they all tickle my (now appearing more poetique) kid need for adventure...

It shouldn't take me very long to find a theme every morning, I can write on any subject as long as 
I write, knowing little or nothing is going to be good. So why do I start writting again ?
I mean for this small 30 minutes exercise to be a time for my thoughts to coalesce and sharpen, 
It is a good way to practice a different type of typing (the "creative" one), learn a little english,
and spelling (altought this would never be the main point for me). It is also very important to 
link different steps in a routine before any progress is made on the "self improvement" that I would 
like to self impose, but I keep postponing... I think those lines summerize my thougths on the subject.
For the same reason, as part of a plan for self improvement, I've not been biting my nails, I wouldn't 
stop smoking completely because this is a bit of the crux of the list but I won't make it an automatic 
responce. going back to math every evening for about 1 hour, before reading before falling a sleep, 
no more movies before going to bed no more podcast to fall a sleep to, if I have to take a break from
work it should be outside or something thoughtful not games, maybe chess, guitar is a good one, 
a new project turning computers into servers, building a kite, speed typing or reading...
In the same vein no more added sugars keep food plain and the final aim is to taste more subtleties
and be more endurant. 

On a different subject, I'll end with an anecdote, something I found intresting, the gecko sticks to 
a glass surface in vertical position or upside down position of a horizontal pane of glass by the 
Van der Waals effect, what is suprising is that there is no liquide or use of surface tention...
The phenomena can be conpared to trying to pull apart two books whose pages have been intertwined, 
it's all friction...

The history of Rome, what I've remembered so far. 
The hard part about Rome's history is to discern the truth from the legends whom are numerous, for 
example there had been settlements in the regions of rome for 5000 years, the actual establishement 
of rome is obscured by the legend of Romulus and Remus, According to this legend the two brother are 
decsendents of Mars(Ares in greek mythology), and a Trojan war hero Aeneas, they were fed by a she wolf 
after being abandoned they built a city, got in an argument Romulus killed Remus, and named the city
after himself, Rome. the city was said to accept men of all class, slaves or freemen, having many men 
very few woman in the city, Romulus invited neighbor tribes to a feast then abducted many woman (this 
is what is known as "The Rape of the Sabine Women". After this war was declared until they settled that 
Titus Tatius the Sabine King would share the kingship with Romulus, whithin Rome 100 of the most noble 
men were chosen to form the Roman senate "patres" (to be of advisory power to the king).
From those patres where formed the patricians, Romulus then divided the population of Rome in to 3 
military units of 100 called "centuries", the Ramnes, the Tities and Luceres. Then he divided the more 
general population into 30 "Curiae", named after the women who had stopped the war between Romulus and 
Tatius...

# 05/02/2023
More on the history of Rome, but a little context first, the city grew from small settlements on the
Palatine Hill about 30km from the Tyrrhenian sea to the south of the Tiber, they were surrounded by 
other settlements, mostly italic-speaking in Latium(plain of the Italian peninsula), the Sabines were 
up the Tiber valley, the Umbrians to the north-east, Samnites to the south. All those Italic speakers 
shared the peninsula with Etruscans to the North and Greeks in the South.
After Romulus comes the 6 others of the "7 kings of Rome", Romulus had established Rome, it's Senate, 
an Army and the first religious instutition. Then came Numa Pompilius reinforced the political and 
religious backbone of Rome, and introduced the 12 month solar calendar.
After him was Tullus Hostilius compared to his predecessor he was a fighter.
Ancus Marcius is the 4th king of Rome, he defeated the Sabines...
Tarquinius Priscus grew Rome a lot, including the Senate, brougth the Cloaca Maxima (one of the first 
sewage system), and the Circus Maxima(the Chariot race stadium).
Then came Servius Tulius, he established the Servian Tribes, a division of the Roman people, and a new 
wall was errected around the city...
Finally came Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, a conqueror, a colonist, he built the Optimus 
Maximus(a temple of Jupiter(Zeus)), as a violent king and disrespectful of Roman custom and the Senate
the people had then a pretty horrible vision of monarchy, they deposed and expelled Tarquinius and his 
familly in 509BC, then established the Roman Republic with Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius 
Collatinus as Rome's first consuls. The term king(rex), held a negative conotation until the end of the 
Roman Empire.

As a good sci-fi book theme, world inside a computer, imagine a tiny earth equivalent in some computer 
people would get shrunk and sent in, everyone would hold a normal job but with out realizing it would
be a simulation for a neural network, the power of the computer would surpass it's consumption because 
you would only simulate a tiny world, there could be details as when those humans decide to travel out
of there worlds they have a special advantageous vacation policy, a programer would become a part time
sociologiste, and would sometimes have to go in and bribe politician to stear the workflow in a way.
This would also solve at least for a time the overpopulation problem, it could be the principle in 
general for that new world to reduce the consumption by shrinking down everything therefore little or
no planetary exploration, ressource optimisation by using it inside a smaller context...
This is a well of allegories and metaphores, may be of good use in a NaNoWriMo sort of thing.
Since this has ran out, I feel like I made my point, we went this week end out to the chalune on skis
with paragliders and it was hard the weigth plus the time, we had a small wind coming from the back 
so trying to lift was sketchy, we started our expedition at 2pm finished around 6:30pm. 
Once you fail with the paraglider, you need to pick yourself up untangle your skis boots, pick it up, 
go back up the slope so you dont start over in the cliff, minding not to cut any strings with your 
ski's edges. Every time it was close but failed for some reason 0 out of 4 tries, you then need to 
fold it how ever you can, put back the 7+ kilos on your back and go back down before you really can't
see anything, it is especialy dangerous on that icy, crusty, kneebreaking "snow".

# 07/02/2023
At this point in our Roman history, the roman republic, thing are a bit more factual and less prone to 
interpretation, less legends. We enter the Roman Republic by overthrowing the Roman Kingdom in 509BC
The Roman republic was primarly a mix of Latin and Etruscan but also in lesser proportionn the Sabine
Oscan and Greek. Politicaly, it developed itself in near paralell to the direct democracy in Ancient 
Greece, it consisted mainly of magistracies overseen by a senate... The 2 consuls were the top 
magistrates. Allthough a small number of famillies monopolised the main magistracies, the Roman Republic
is considered one of the first examples of representative democracy. They had to adapte instutionaly one
example of that adaptation is instoration of promagistracies (consuls who had their role extended to go
"rule" in conquered territories).
The main ennemies of Rome came as Latin and Etruscan neighbours and the Gauls who are well know for the
sack of Rome in 387BC (this was one hard hit on the Romans), to be precis the Gauls came from the 
North-West of the Alps, what is now France, Switzerland, Southern Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic.
The sack is a story of its own, I need more context...

# 11/02/2023
By 338BC, the end of the Latin War, the Latins submitted to Roman rule. That came right after the First 
Samnite war where the Romans had come to the rescue of Capua in Campania. The Latin War was won at the 
battles of Vesuvius and Trifanum, this is one of the first territory expansion of the Romans, the Latin 
leagues submitted to Roman rule or where wiped of the map... This is when the Second Samnite War began in 
327BC. This War ended in 305BC at the Battle of Bovianum, the advantages of one group over the other was
not decisive until 314 where Rome taking the upperside offered less and less to there peace terms.
One year after the Battle Bovianum Rome had taken over most of the Samnite territory, but in 298BC the 
Samnites rebelled and defeated a Roman army, this gave rise to a coalition of several previous enemies of 
Rome, this war ended once more with Roman victory in 290BC, Rome decisively finished off the last part of 
the Etruscan power in the region at the Battle of Populonia in Tuscany.
The 4th century before BC is also a time marked by the forthcoming of the plebeians into the political 
realm where they gained power until they finally had equal political rights with the patricians.
In 400 BC the first plebian consular tribunes were elected, in 385BC the former consul and savior of the 
besieged Rome, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, is said to have repaid the debt of many plebeians by selling
his own estate, the first patrician to do so. The growing unrest he had brought, got him sentenced to 
death trialed under the pretext of seeking kingly power, he was thrown from the Tarpeian Rock.

Today I'm wandering if you have a logical probleme or something to solve in general is it possible that
your mind/brain helps you solve it uncounsciously or in your sleep. Beyond the funny aspect and the 
complet lack of humility what does it mean, is there some truth to it, and how to help it ? 
It would seem obvious enought that the probleme you are treating in that way are usually not very 
pragmatical ones but more of the affective/emotional order, on the other hand you may sometimes get stuck 
on a logical/hard-science problem with only one true answer, and not want to face it for emotional issues,
, or have been stuck on it to long and realize your ideas to solve the probleme are becoming irrational
in those cases it would make sense to go to sleep.
In other words our brain would in the typical human biasses fashion, only help in decision making, or the 
"what should I do when I wake up ?(more or less)", the harvard blogpost below says it is the way the brain
links what stired you in your day and saves them in memory, for when night time falls it starts categorizing 
and processing in the background with the aim to both get used to the idea and make a better or more 
thoughtful answer, sleeping on it...
If I bring this back on my experience all the dreams I did about a factual probleme where never solved in a 
dream but they where always there as an abstract idea I can't solve, I'm guessing it is to familiarize my
self with the idea of falling and having a problem that is to complicated for me... until you've spent enough
time...

# 13/02/2023
I've been reading slowly the "myth of sisyphus" by Albert Camus. This is an attempt at explaning what I've 
understood so far. In very general terms the central idea is that of the absurde and how it is in conflict 
with our wannabe logical view, our hopes and our general aim at finding the truth and a reality...
He goes about the subject on multiple sides one of wich seems to be the sucide, and how it can be interpretaded,
religion, and other philosophers views on the subject.
To Camus absurd is our evironement the world we live in, the man that lives in it and thinks in it is partialy 
rational and aims for a logical view, a clear objectif in life, a truth, and this is what creates the conflict 
we, to Albert Camus, are aiming for something the world can't offer to us by definition. The title of the book 
is a reference to the mythe of the same title, Sisyphe or Prometheus in Greek mythology founder of Corinth son 
of Eole a hero, is punished by Zeus (Jupiter) to push a rock up a mountain, to have it fall back down by the end 
of the climb and start over and over again, this is an image of how life is both cyclic and pointless (the absurd
of life), all the while Sisyphe tries to justify it's action to himself, clearly representing the humans...
Althought he doesn't give any clear position on the matter and aims more at finding the right questions, the 
opposite would be kind of paradoxal, one of the ideas that kind of sticks to me is that of embrassing absurdity,
wich means in part you abandon all hope and stay in a perpetual questioning without ever aiming for a clearcut 
answer, this links back to Simone de Beauvoir and her idea to embrasse ambiguity, she also was an existantialist
after all.
In loosing hope, and all hope of a clear answer to the question of life, his aim is not sucide or even sadness,
but a kind of blissful ignorance, be absurd and don't get stuck trying to find a meaning in life, it might not 
have one...

# 14/02/2023
In that same book, Camus, start on a subject, the chapter is the absurd liberty. I believe he is all of a sudden 
making huge jumps in his train of thought, and kind of gets to a point to fast, for it to be based on reasoning,
it seems more like a write from the heart, that parodixacly makes it a lot more engaging...
But this is beyond the point, he starts talking about how for us to reconnect to the world, to the absurde, we 
would need to adapt perpetualy both our consciousness and our dissaproval (revolte in french), to not fall in 
view that try to reduce the world to a simple and generaly just human comprehenssible explaination. To Camus, it
seems the rule of thumb is, if its understandable if it seem logical or that it is proven, it can not be the answer,
therefore stop asking the question, and start spending your time as an inoncent mind, like a kid, but once you start
beleiving in something ask for an other opinion.
When I red this part earlier, for some reason my idea got stuck on the actual word revolt in french and I was stuck
on this idea of revolution, I realize now that it was mainly used as "shifting asside an idea in your mind or 
demantling it", still the idea stuck, being a revolutionist in a sens is disagreeing in the hopes of changing
something, maybe the state of mind of people, and in that sens both could link.
This is not who I am right now, but the reflection is intresting, if my objectif in life was to convert people to 
my way of thinking what would be my underline main idea. How would I express my morals and lead to a greater 
humanity. The small ideas are relatively easy to come by, the big picture is hard to come by, its even harder,
and that might be a good thing, to be certain about it.
Test a preconception ; "If a person has a certainty about a soft subject he is either stupid or dishonest."

# 19/02/2023
The fall(la chute) is a book also about Albert Camus from 1956, in this book Camus tries to frame a picture in our 
head of man who thinks himself the perfect entity to represent humankind, he is both by his action and other people's 
perception a genuinly good person. The reason for the title of the book is revealed as, when he encounters a few, test
of life, testing his perfect morals, he turns out to be just a human being after all. Those test of life turn out to be 
a "revers baptisme" to him... Meaning he fell, trying after this to avoid judgement, trouble, and therefore any false 
sens of dignity. And now starts the guessing game for me as I've not red the book, the end probably goes around the idea
that his mind surrenders to the "absurd", abandoning completly the search of meaning a not having any set of moral, nor
the will to build one.
I think that would kind of show a moral to the book, don't underestimate the faculty that life has to shatter your moral 
policy's, If you think you are in a pretty safe cocoon then think again, you can either get very luky and coast through 
life, being a lamb to, other's dogma or your own, or you could face one of those "test of life" and be broken and then 
are you going to build back up... 
I'm writing being fully convinced that this sort of fall would never happen to me, although I'm aware that this could 
happen to anyone, paradoxical...
The aim might be to where a mask of morals that emulate a well suited Human in a civilized world, under wich is the 
deeper truth that nothing needs to make sens and that everything that we build our sens of moral on is our previous 
creation or interpretation... Get the book, read the book...

# 25/02/2023
I've been in morzine for the last 3 or 4 days, my sister and two of my nieces and my stepbrother where there on vacation, 
I have very mixed feelings about them, they live in a very different world then I do, Versailles or Saint-Germain-en-Lay, 
should say a lot on it's own. To me it's a lot of preaching and acting in a certain way to act both thoughtful, responssible, 
civilised and educated, a few examples to further my case, the children are forced through school in concepts and ideas that 
are not of any intrest to them and probably very shallow as the education system does(for once I'm not blaming school all the 
subjects can not always be of interest and teachers can not share a passion on every subject, we are human after all), my 
point is that forcing your kids through school in the pursuit of grades for the sake of grades and social stance is one way
to get completly lost, we are making a big mistake aiming for scores... we should aim for knowledge. 
The rest is small stuff but show a whole, making fun in home of people with holes in their socks, eating on a plat out of
principals, arguing by repeating the same thing with a different entonation, thinking it is okay to go teach indians in the 
slums, words of english to have your "eye opening moment" in your life, that is super arrogant, and in the same time I dont 
really know what would be better, I have a bit more respect for the spectating aspect of things. but I dont know why...
And that step brother of mine is now a different person to my eyes, thinks he is so inteligent tries to prove it, by orienting 
the subject around his feilds, never asks you a real question always with a bouncing reaction to your responce, to show his 
goodness, has a very twisted way of thinking and talks about it as a clear advantage where it often proves to be the exact 
opposite... He is short-tempered, when told wrong, with very shallow argumentation he will try to show you your wrong.
Anyways I shouldn't keep finding things wrong with them at least from my point of view, I should try to see what I don't to 
be or what I do want to be... I'm lucky to have those people to help me ask myself that question, because in our interactions 
I was also far from perfect... Tomorow should be about what I want to be and dont want to be in comparison... 

# 26/02/2023
Writing about what I want to be and maybe about what I dont want to be, I need to be more organized stop wasting my time and 
be more productive for myself, focus on higher pleasures no more screens except for work go out running and have projects. 
This all seems simple, but those ideals are to harsh and hard to put in place, it's been one and a half year I've been 
orbiting around that idea of the "perfect self", lets try it again, until I make it... Establish strict rules and stick to
them, without the overworking aspect of it, so I don't crash, if I need a break I can choose between, going out, reading, 
working on a project, sleeping, meditating or play guitar. Be a bit more methodical about your work, how you do it and a 
quick analises of what was done with an idea for further improvement. This expresses whom I want to be intelectualy, both
the easy part and one that is primordial (it allows you the time to think about the other). 
The other therefore is moral and attitude, my social interaction, the aim in this orientation is less clear and I believe 
it is to be built as I go, but as a base I can say this, nothing is obvious, don't force your opinions on any one, cherrich
friends that confront your ideas and try to hear them and question them, to dig the "why ?", and make the distinction between
with friends that are always supportive. Epresse your profound opinions as a detached idea that is just a thougth, don't back
it with your life. Having a list of prethought questions or phrases to test, with the aim of reorienting the subject, something
like "I'm of different opinion, can you explain yours and what backs it so I better understand your views?" and "why ?".
Find my own values to judge people and make an effort not to depend on those created by society, or biases, one would be, to 
not judge intelligence on what someone knows, that would be knowledge, intelligence is a sum of multiple thing the capacity to 
listen, understand, intrest, logique to a certain extent, doubt, perseverance, ect... And then use those criterias of judgement 
rather positif or negative, to better myself and apply them on a daily basis...
Alrigth, welcome to your rebirth...

What are and what is the difference between dark matter and dark energy, well dark matter is a placeholder name for about 85% 
of the matter in the universe that we dont see and don't see the interactions of (at least not directly, because it does have 
mass and therefore a gravitational force, this is how it was discovered), it does not interact to the electromagnetic field, 
it does not react to light is an other way of saying this, this is why it is called "dark".
This idea of dark matter emerges from the calculations of many galaxies that according to the amount of matter we see should not 
behave gravitationaly the way they do. It does not interact with baryonic matter (all the matter we know), it is therefore thougth
to be non-baryonic matter (in the likes of neutrinos, free electrons and what composes black holes), it is supposed to be composed 
of subatomic particles not yet discovered but the group is called in the mean time the WIMP's for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles.
Dark matter is classified as cold, warm or hot, in relation to the velocity, current models favor a cold dark matter scenario in wich 
galaxies form by gradual accumulation. 
Although this is the most commonly accepted theory, other astrophysicists argue for different models or revision of general relativity.
These would be, the modified Newtonian dynamics, tensor-vector-scalar gravity, entropic gravity, those try to explain all observation

About Dark energy, it is also a place-holder name for an energy not yet discovered, it affects the univers on a large scale, and is 
not very visible from our standing point. It's been theorized after the witnessing of multiple supernovas, they showed that the universe 
did not seem to expand at constant rate but rather an accelerating one. Before this it was thought that the total of masses and energy 
in the univers was going to slow down the expansion of the universe over time. There was no other way to introduce the accelerating 
expansion of the universe without a new variable, the as of yet unexplained, "dark energy". The current estimate indicate that dark 
energy takes about 68% of the total energy in the present observerbal universe. In the total mass-energy ordinary (baryonic) and 
dark matter contributes 26%, and 5% respectively. 
Dark energy is often called "vaccum energy of space" as it seems to be the external energy pulling the universe to an acceleration, 
there are many different theorise on how to incorporate this new notion in the models we already know or how to create new ones to 
take it into account, the  "Cosmological constant" is the most widely acknowledge an fits the "dark energy" as a Cosmological constant,
in this model it spreads itself through the universe homogeneously (Lambda-CDM model). A second proposition is that of the "Quintessence"
where the dark energy is visualized more as a dynamical field.

I've been messing around with this microcontroler, called Elegoo, there are a lot of new concepts linked to circutry, the very theorical 
part of resistance Ohm's, joule's first law and the way a diode or more generaly a semiconductor works, then there is the more hands on 
side of circuitry that is hard to output for me in text...
Joule's first law is also called joule heating, resistive, resistance, or Ohmic heating, it is in essence the heat produced by current 
passing through a conductor. 
P = I^2 * R; This formula say's Power is equal to Intensity squared times the resistance.
This Joule's law comes from James Prescott Joule 1818 - 1889, he was an English physicist, mathematician and brewer (cool dude).
A potential difference (voltage) between two points of a conductor creates an electric field that accelarates a charge carrier in the
direction of the electric field, giving them kinetic energy. When the charge particles collid with the quasi-particles (I don't know what 
quasi-particles are, do ask) in the conductor, the energy ends up being transfered from the electrons to the lattice, the oscillations of
the ions are the origin of the radiation ("thermal energy").

This is going to be about the semiconductor, the main idea is that the diode or the transistors (which are responsible for most of the 
modern circuits, phones, computers...), are based on this material. There are obvious conductors like copper or gold, there ar some obvious
insulator like plastic or rubber, and there are the less obvious like silicon (mainly), but also germanium, gallium arsenid and a few different
elements near the "metalloid staircase" on the periodic table. In it's self silicon is not a good conductor, altought they are 
sometimes used intrinsicly in this case they have a very low conductivity, it is based on the fact that electrons in the valence shell (the
outer most shell) is saturated or not, we consider that atoms of elements that are conductor have less then 3 electrons in their valence 
shell, copper, gold and platinium have 1, aluminium (a lesser conductor has 3), and our silicon has 4 exactly half of a saturated valence 
shell, when those atoms group together they fill each others valence shell effectevily leaving us with 8 electrons in each atoms valence shell.
This time it is saturated...

We left with our silicon atoms being saturted, this is good but the main use for silicon is different the use we have for its intrinsic form, 
the next step in the creation of our diodes, transistors or other semiconductor based basic hardware, is doping. Again what makes a good insulator
is the fact that the valence shell of the atoms is saturated, by adding a tiny proportion (1 in 10^8) of an element that holds 3 (trivalen; boron, 
gallium or indium) or 5 (pentavalent; antimonium, phosphorus, arsenic) electrons in its valence shell, we are unbalencing the perfect saturated 
cristaline structure of the silicon by one, and therefore allowing current to flow. We call a semiconductor that it is doped with donor impurities
a n-type semiconductor (negative charge excess) because the added element has 5 electrons on it valence shell, the oposite is a semiconductor with 
acceptor impurities, a p-type of semiconductor (positive charge excess) because the added element has 3 electrons in its valence shell and is 
therefore letting current through these parts... Suprisingly those two semconductor types dont act the same way, next time we explore this 
dichotomy in the study of a Diode or a Light emitting Diode.
