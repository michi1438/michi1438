The style would be, Social Fiction, looks like science fiction but it has little technological advancement, it mainly focusses on social differences, ethical dilema and a challenge to our society's paradigm... Turns out the "name" already exists as Social Science Fiction, typiclaly Orwell, Huxley, Clark are explorers of those subject !

**THEME_1**
Story of a man, in a modern world where there are no rule, no governing power, the main character (Roger) would be a pass-time theorist, or someone with a role of the sort, maybe a problem solver for others a kind of lawyer in a world with no law, a dancer of the dangers of a world who self balances with rules not set by any man but by man's nature... 
One way to describe this is to talk of anarchism, and this would be in all fairness, another would be to talk of "raw freedom".
(in this fiction the word "anarchism" would not exist, many words wouldn't, some would be only theorized like "law" or "crime", these concept would not really exist at least not with the same meaning or magnitude, "law" would be studied as we study dictatorship, for this world their implicit laws are just an extention of nature or human nature and not worth labeling)
An eye for an eye might be what you would expect, but the prospect of worse "a life for an eye" actually tempers most people. For the sake of argument, there are very few crimes, the majority of those crimes are passionate and are the result of poor self-control or very challenged minds. Psycopath would be hired by the likes of Roger, they would have there full place in such a society; purely logical, no passion and therefore no crime (the nuance here is important, a psycopath is not requierd to kill ^^), and smart people that would suffer the crimes of a more rash and otherwise stupid person would hire the likes of Roger to get ride of that "inconvenience to society" in a clean fashion to avoid repercussions, and it solves both problem of people getting smarter and less aggressive by natural selection.
No centralized authority, no prison, no large scale economy, no financial up and down on the global market, room for everyone to start grow to a human scale and pass to the next, no bank would grow to big because the risk reward would be to high.
There are a few ways the story could be brought, distopian directly outlining the shortcommings of such a society or lack of, a reverse distopian where the world is a happy place til a group trying to bring order and laws ruin the freedom of this setting, a third way is to stay purely utopian and let the story be framed by the concept and not modify the society's structure. Maybe sections that explore each of these in sequence. 
I want readers to think, how is this different from our world at a fundemental level? Why did we get stuck in our ways? What would actually happen if we tried? Isn't anarchy what we had in the very begining and isn't our model the natural developement of anarchism?

**THEME_2**
A Story based in a world where nomadic life is the standard, man hasn't tried to settle or sedentarize, the earth would be the same, as technologicaly advanced, but just not settled, the question is how do you justify that most of our modern technology and underline theoretical concept is based on hummans settling and fighting over what they consider their land or culture, that, is again given by humans having settled, either I skip the explaning or I come up with a good example of a great discovery or the like that happend to someone on the road and extrapolate from there, this would again be a planet without borders "mondialisation" would not be a thing, cultures and societies would not be a thing, ideas would fluidly transit from one man to another. Would people travel on foot, by car or something else?
What might be intresting is, theoretical background would be similar, but the technological implications would be different, houses would not have the same value in those societies, anything built to be or built by a centralised authority like celltowers, roads, powerplants would not be possible, how do you reimagine all this? 
This could somewhat tie up with the previous theme, no laws would make sense in this kind of world.kkkk
I might need to ask a bunch of those question and kind of sculpt a world from the answers I try to give?

**NO_THEME**    (just an idea)
We live in a world where it is well looked upon to procrate when we dont have enough to feed every one, and once we realise these children are ill or generaly unfit for the world in autonomy we consider it cruel to not take extensive care of them. The demographics are getting out of hand. In such a world individuals are as big a polluter as big corporations. Having less kids, when I think about it, does not seem to be the more human thing to do (having kids is the most human thing to do) but it might be the right thing to do. I've not often seen quality in quantity, rather it be education or gene pools it seems to me we would gain as a society to not make as many fucking babies. And once I have said this, usualy the first bullshit counterpoint is that it's not our "advanced country" that polute the world, fuck you, you said "advanced" !! Try to transcend, don't see this as a me vs them problem, but more as a what can I do about it, it's simple really if you are better then the third world country's population help them out, stop making babies start adopting. If your not, same thing, stop making more average babies, start adopting !!

**THEME_1&2_Q&A**
Q:  When two parties genuinely disagree about who wronged whom, how is "truth" established without courts?
A:  Well, first of all when we do have courts and it has ruled who is to say that we have truth, and once sentencing has been done isn't there multiple truths if 2 or more parties **GENUINELY** Disagree...
Truth is established by the parties that are the most intrested and by their hired third party, that is where the beauty of sush a (non)system comes in, their judgement is both passionate and measured by the empiricaly known backlash that an overly-hard judgement may bring... this cleaves with our blind system that bases it self on outdated rules that don't always fit the current moral standards, counters new rules or directly gives loopholes to a clever but possibly evil defence. 
Law is often seen and pictured as trying to fit the legal text to the desirable judgment, not only is it a quirky funny representation of the imperfect thing that is law, legal text and judgement, it shows the ridilousness of trying to fit something that is intangible and so prone to opinion and subjectivity in a strict and tight medium of everexpending text that keeps retroactively correcting itself as the values of a people change.. 
"find study cases that kind of showcase that" (#answerd, #meta, #fundamental, #world-building)

Q:  What happens when someone like Roger makes a mistake and eliminates the wrong person?
A:  This is a very broad question, with multiple answers.
If he is good enough at his job he probably will not make a mistake and if he did would then not get caught, edge case, may be a good theme to explore...
If he did get caught, that would probably be a sign that he is not very good at his job. As a whole him getting killed might be a good thing for hummanity, it will show that this line of work isn't a walk in the parc that it should be taken seriously, that these profession are not above any other, that it is a high risk high reward... All in all it may be akin to a virtuous cycle of a positive feedback loop, one mistake in the loop doesn't break the loop, but strenghtens it... In this case the Roger like person, making a mistake is a blessing because it will remind everybody of the dangers of making a mistake, if it doesn't on the first error then on the next...
This is all the utopist point of view this cycle or this loop could oviously be a vicious cycle I think I want to take the Utopist side, I like it better...(#unanswerd)

Q:  How do children learn the "implicit rules" if they're never written down?
A:  They don't or "implicit rules" are learned implicitly ^^, this is kind of a non-sensical question, "implicit rules" would not be written down, those would have been called "explicit rules", and that is kind of the point, we don't want those in this scenario, the "implicit rules" are more akin to the fundemental "laws" of natures and human nature, feelings and personal, "cultural" and/or any other kind of influence on moral values... 
Rules that would be written down or given as a standard in any form, would not be common, and usually no direct judgement would be based on such rules, the few stories that there would be of such "written down rules" would be anecdotic and affiliated with revolutionary groups, cult-like followings, and would be word of mouth and therefore lost rapidly or in a cult complex that stored information for centuries before disbanding like all the others, there would be a sort of "archeologist" specificaly intrested in what the world was like before and this would probably be an important work too colporteur of information in the form of storytelling...
