story of a man, in a modern world where there is no rule, no governing power, the main man (Rogers) would be a theorist, or someone with a role linked to that aspect, maybe a sort of problem solver for other 
a kind of lawyer in a world with no law, a dancer of the dangers of a world who balances it self out by rules not set by any man but by natur... an eye for an eye might be what you would expect,
but actually the prospect of worse ("a life for an eye"), actually tempers most people, and from this the majority of crimes (for the sake of argument would be low), are passionate or obtained, by 
poor self-control or very challenged people, psycopath would be hired by people like Rogers, and smart people that would suffer the crimes of a more rach or stupid person would hire in turn people like Rogers
to clean up that person to avoid repercussions, and it solves both problem of people getting smarter and less aggressive...
