story of a man, in a modern world where there are no rule, no governing power, the main man (Rogers) would be a theorist, or someone with a role linked to that aspect, maybe a sort of problem solver for others a kind of lawyer in a world with no law, a dancer of the dangers of a world who balances it self out by rules not set by any man but by nature... an eye for an eye might be what you would expect, but actually the prospect of worse ("a life for an eye"), actually tempers most people, and from this the majority of crimes (for the sake of argument are very few) are passionate, the result of poor self-control or very challenged people, psycopath would be hired by people like Rogers, and smart people that would suffer the crimes of a more rach or stupid person would hire in turn people like Rogers to get ride of that person in a clean fashion to avoid repercussions, and it solves both problem of people getting smarter, less aggressive, and the world could never sustain horribly outaded, useless laws or worse, that profit a certain group of people more than an other...

We live in a world where it is rewarded to have children but as a whole we dont have enough to even feed every one, and then when we realise these children are ill or generaly unfit for the world in autonomy we consider it cruel to not take extensive care of them. The demographics are getting out of hand in a world that were individuals are as big of polluer as big corp. Having less kids when I think about it does not seem to be the more human thing to do, as we can see but maybe the right thing to do, I've not often seen quality in quantity, rather it be education or gene pools it seems to me we would gain as humans to not make as many fu**ing babies. And ones you have read this usualy the first bullshit counterpoint is that it's not our "advanced country" that polute the world
