**Fly away**
I wish that I could fly away, maybe the people wouldn't know what to say,
Some night I might fly my way, maybe the birds wouldn't give me away,

If only the people.... would come out to play...
If only the people.... knew how to play.... oooooh... what -- a -- beau -- ti -- full day.
I only wish the people.... would'nt go away....

**We could go fishing**
Sing a pretty song, one that would'nt do no harm, 
Sing a sing-along, no matter the sun or the storm,

We could go fishing, but we might just stay inside, 
We try breaethin in the sunlight, but we might just stay inside, 

**THEMES**
- unclear messages, interpretable, contradictory, childish, happy sad, melancoly, letting go, simplicity, cool riffs, more chords...
