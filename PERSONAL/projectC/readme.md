The zero of a potential can be defined where you like. This is because you only ever see differences in potential from one place to another. Well... I guess strictly speaking that is not universally true. But for purposes of your homework assignment it is. That means you can add any constant onto the potential and get an equally valid potential. All it does is redefine where the zero is. By using the form that your assignment has it has defined the zero of to be at which seems a natural place to define it.
